ANALYSIS REPORT: GAN vs Collaborative Filtering Under Adversarial Noise

1. CLEAN DATA PERFORMANCE
============================================================
On clean test data, CF achieved superior Precision@5 of 0.0527.

2. PERFORMANCE UNDER NOISE
============================================================
CF degraded by 6.80%, GAN degraded by 6.61%.
Robustness winner: GAN (maintains 0.18% more performance).

3. RECOMMENDATIONS
============================================================
Use GAN in noisy/attack-prone environments.
Use CF in clean/controlled environments.
